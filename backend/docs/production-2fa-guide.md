# Production-Ready 2FA Implementation Guide

This document outlines the production-ready Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) implementation for SecureVote Tanzania.

## Overview

The 2FA implementation uses the Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) standard, which is compatible with popular authenticator apps like Google Authenticator, Authy, and Microsoft Authenticator.

## Key Components

### Backend Implementation

1. **Libraries Used**:
   - `speakeasy`: For generating TOTP secrets and validating TOTP tokens
   - `qrcode`: For generating QR codes for easy setup with authenticator apps

2. **User Model Fields**:
   - `mfaEnabled`: Boolean indicating if 2FA is enabled for the user
   - `mfaSecret`: String containing the user's TOTP secret (stored securely)

3. **API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/auth/setup-2fa`: Generates a new 2FA secret for the user
   - `/api/auth/verify-setup-2fa`: Verifies the user's first TOTP token and enables 2FA
   - `/api/auth/verify-2fa`: Validates a TOTP token during login
   - `/api/auth/disable-2fa`: Disables 2FA for a user (requires TOTP token for security)

4. **Security Middleware**:
   - `require2FA`: Middleware that checks if a valid TOTP token is provided for protected routes

### Frontend Implementation

1. **2FA Setup Flow**:
   - QR code display for easy scanning with authenticator apps
   - Manual entry code provided as a fallback
   - Verification step to confirm the user has set up their authenticator correctly

2. **Login Flow**:
   - Standard username/password authentication
   - Secondary TOTP verification for users with 2FA enabled
   - Clean error handling for invalid tokens

3. **User Settings**:
   - Interface for users to enable/disable 2FA
   - Clear instructions for users to set up authenticator apps

## Security Considerations

1. **Secrets Storage**:
   - 2FA secrets are never exposed in API responses after initial setup
   - Secrets are stored in the database using the `select: false` option

2. **Brute Force Prevention**:
   - API rate limiting prevents brute force attempts
   - TOTP tokens have a narrow window of validity (typically 30 seconds)

3. **Recovery Options**:
   - Administrators can disable 2FA for users who lose access to their authenticator
   - Consider implementing backup codes in future versions

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Token Window**:
   - A small window parameter (Â±1) allows for minor time synchronization issues
   - This gives a total window of ~90 seconds where a token might be valid

2. **Required Roles**:
   - 2FA is highly recommended for admin and auditor roles
   - New admin and auditor accounts have 2FA disabled initially, allowing first login
   - After first login, users should set up 2FA through the Settings page
   - Implementation supports making 2FA optional or required for other roles

3. **Security Verification**:
   - Disabling 2FA requires providing a valid TOTP token
   - 2FA setup requires verification to ensure user has configured their authenticator correctly

## Testing Instructions

1. **Enable 2FA**:
   - Log in as an admin or auditor
   - Navigate to Settings
   - Click "Setup Two-Factor Authentication"
   - Scan the QR code with an authenticator app
   - Enter the verification code to complete setup

2. **Login with 2FA**:
   - Enter username and password
   - You'll be redirected to the 2FA page
   - Enter the code from your authenticator app

3. **Disable 2FA**:
   - Navigate to Settings
   - Click "Disable Two-Factor Authentication"
   - Enter the current code from your authenticator app

## Future Enhancements

1. **Backup Codes**: Implement one-time use backup codes for recovery
2. **Remember Device**: Option to remember trusted devices
3. **Push Notifications**: Support for push notification-based 2FA
4. **Risk-Based Authentication**: Implement adaptive security based on user behavior
