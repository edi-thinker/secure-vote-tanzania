# Production Deployment Guide

This document provides guidance for deploying the SecureVote Tanzania system in a production environment.

## Security Considerations

Before deployment, ensure the following security measures are implemented:

1. **Remove Development Features**:
   - Ensure `NODE_ENV` is set to 'production'
   - Verify that development routes are not accessible
   - Remove or secure any test accounts

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Use strong, unique values for all secrets
   - Store environment variables securely (not in code)
   - Use different secrets for development and production

3. **Database Security**:
   - Use a dedicated database user with limited permissions
   - Enable authentication and TLS for database connections
   - Configure proper network security for database access

4. **API Security**:
   - Configure CORS properly to restrict access
   - Implement rate limiting for all endpoints
   - Use HTTPS for all communications

## Production Deployment Steps

### 1. Backend Setup

a) Configure production environment variables:

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://[production-db-url]/secure-vote
JWT_SECRET=[strong-random-secret]
JWT_EXPIRE=1d
JWT_COOKIE_EXPIRE=1
CORS_ORIGIN=https://[your-production-domain]
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

b) Install dependencies and build:

```powershell
cd e:\secure-vote\backend
npm install --production
```

c) Set up a process manager (PM2 recommended):

```powershell
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start server.js --name "secure-vote-backend"
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

### 2. Frontend Setup

a) Configure production environment variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.[your-production-domain]
```

b) Build the frontend:

```powershell
cd e:\secure-vote\frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

c) Deploy the build output:
   - Use Vercel, Netlify, or a similar service for hosting
   - Alternatively, serve statically with Nginx or Apache

### 3. Creating Production Admin/Auditor Accounts

For production, you should:

1. Create a secure script to generate admin accounts with proper MFA
2. Use a secure method for distributing credentials
3. Enforce immediate password change on first login

Example secure admin creation:

```powershell
# Use a one-time script with secure MFA setup
node scripts/create-secure-admin.js --email="admin@example.com" --name="Admin User"
```

### 4. Monitoring and Maintenance

1. Set up logging and monitoring:
   - Configure centralized logging
   - Set up alerts for security events
   - Monitor system health and performance

2. Implement backup strategy:
   - Regular database backups
   - Secure storage of backup files
   - Test restoration procedures

3. Update and patch regularly:
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Apply security patches promptly
   - Review and test changes before deployment

## SSL Configuration

Ensure all traffic is encrypted:

1. Obtain SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt recommended)
2. Configure your web server for HTTPS
3. Implement HSTS headers
4. Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

## Load Balancing and Scaling

For high-demand scenarios:

1. Set up load balancing for the API server
2. Consider database sharding or replication
3. Implement caching where appropriate
4. Use CDN for static frontend assets

## Disaster Recovery

Prepare for potential issues:

1. Document recovery procedures
2. Implement automated health checks
3. Configure automatic failover where possible
4. Test recovery procedures regularly
